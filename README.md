# Generate HTML documentation from SPARQL queries

`sparql-doc` provides a simple tool for generating browsable HTML documentation 
from SPARQL queries.

This is particularly useful when preparing training materials or resources to 
help developers to use a particular dataset or SPARQL endpoint.

## SPARQL Documentation Extensions

`sparql-doc` processes your SPARQL queries and looks for comments. Like Javadoc, rdoc and 
similar tools, the content of the comments are used to provide metadata

All simple documentation lines at the start of a query will be treated as its description. E.g:

	#This is a description
	#of my query. It has multiple
	#lines
	DESCRIBE ?x 

Special tag can be used to specify other metadata, such as the title of a query:

	#This is a description
	#of my query. It has multiple
	#lines
	# @title My Query Title
	DESCRIBE ?x 

The full list of supported tags is:

* `@title`: should have a single value. Last title tag wins
* `@author`: author(s) of the query. Can have multiple uses
* `@see`: add a link from the documentation
* `@param`: parameter. Not yet used in template
* `@endpoint`: suggested endpoint for query. Not yet used in template
* `@tag`: add a tag to a query. Not yet used, but this will (eventually) be used to organise queries

Here's an example that uses all these:

	#This query illustrates how to describe a resource which is identified
	#by matching one of its properties. In this case a work is being identified
	#using its ISBN-10 value.
	# @title Describe via ISSN
	# @author Leigh Dodds
	# @see http://www.isbn.org/
	# @tag book
	# @tag isbn
	PREFIX bibo: <http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/> 
	DESCRIBE ?uri WHERE {
	  ?uri bibo:isbn10 "0261102214".
	}

The query description can be written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). So 
you can include embedded markup, e.g. links, that help to further document a query.
 
## Example

Here's [the example output](http://ldodds.github.com/sparql-doc/) using the example queries included in the project.

## Installation

The application is based on Ruby 1.9.3 and uses the JSON and [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) gems.

For now the quickest way to install the code is:

	git clone https://github.com/ldodds/sparql-doc.git
	rake package
	rake install
	
## Usage

Once installed you should have a `sparql-doc` command-line tool. This takes two parameters:

* The input directory. The tool will process all `.rq` files in that directory
* The output directory. All HTML output and required assets will be placed here
	
E.g. you can run:

	sparql-doc examples/bnb /your/output/directory
	
This will generate documentation from the bundled examples and place it into the specified 
directory.

Later versions will support additional command-line options

## TODO

* Make better use of the command-line
* Injection of environment variables/parameters via package.json
* Support @endpoint as a global parameter
* Supporting running queries from documentation
* Configurable templates
* Handling of nested directories
